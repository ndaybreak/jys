In a decentralized system, the internet is a community of users and a network of independent machines that power and host information. This not only removes central hands from the levers of control, but also makes systems more resilient to failures and hacks, while ensuring there is no element of vulnerability. This appeals to everyone worldwide, and it is undoubtedly the future of sharing information — it’s only a matter of time before decentralization of information and power becomes commonplace.</span>
